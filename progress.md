# GoFetch Build Progress

**Implementation progress:** 14%

**Completed implementation checkpoints:** 1 of 7

**Current checkpoint:** Checkpoint 2 — Generic target resolution, research, and planning

**Current status:** Checkpoint 1 complete and pushed; Checkpoint 2 ready to begin.

The complete product definition, architecture, acceptance criteria, and Checkpoints 0–7 live in `scope.md`. This file only records actual build progress and verification evidence as work is completed.

## Progress rules

- Progress increases only when working, verified implementation is completed.
- A checkpoint is complete only after its exit criteria in `scope.md` pass and its commit is pushed to GitHub.
- Every completed checkpoint records its commit, verification commands, and important implementation notes here.
- Useful interim work may be committed and pushed, but partial work does not increase the completed-checkpoint count.
- Completing Checkpoint 7 means the assignment is fully built, tested, deployed, documented, and ready to submit.

## Baseline — 2026-08-08

- Repository initialized and connected to `https://github.com/0xnotdev/gofetch.git`.
- Detailed build specification consolidated into `scope.md`.
- No application skeleton, runtime code, tests, browser automation, or deployment exists yet.
- Implementation therefore starts at **0%**.

## Completed checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1 — Runnable application and test foundation

**Status:** complete

**Implementation commit:** `398418d`

**Delivered:**

- Next.js 16 and TypeScript application with a reviewer-facing input form.
- Public `POST /api/runs` boundary that accepts arbitrary app names or requirements and creates a typed run in `resolving` state.
- Blank and malformed input handling.
- Typed run states, progress events, human-intervention requests, credential results, and failure results.
- Environment schema, npm scripts, ESLint, Vitest, production build, and GitHub Actions CI.
- Local setup and verification documentation.

**TDD evidence:** the first run-creation test failed because the route did not exist, then passed after the minimal implementation. Blank-input and malformed-body tests were each observed failing before their behavior was implemented.

**Verification evidence:**

- `npm ci` — passed; 0 reported vulnerabilities.
- `npm test` — passed; 3 tests.
- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm run lint` — passed.
- `npm run build` — passed; `/` and `/api/runs` built successfully.
- Production-server smoke test — `/` returned HTTP 200 and a generic requirements query returned `state: resolving` from `/api/runs`.
- `git diff --check` — passed.

## Active checkpoint

### Checkpoint 2 — Generic target resolution, research, and planning

**Status:** not started

**Next action:** define the public resolution/plan result fixtures at the approved run API seam, then implement the first direct-name resolution tracer bullet.
